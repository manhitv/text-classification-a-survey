# Text Classification - A survey with hands-on examples

## Introduction

In this repository, I have surveyed approaches to a typical Text Classification problem and demonstrated through hands-on examples. Those are some opinions on text processing methods, text classfication algorithms and some utilities when working with text data.

## Table of Contents

### Text and Document Feature Extraction
**1. Introduction to data preprocessing**

- *Data cleaning*
- *Data wrangling*
- *Data reduction or instance/feature selection and extraction*

**2. Text Cleaning and Pre-processing**

- *Must Do*
- *Should Do*
- *Task Dependent*

There are some techniques that help to deal with these problems such as *Tokenization*, *Stop words*, *Capitalization*, *Slangs and Abbreviations*, *Spelling Correction*, *Stemming*, *Lemmatization*.

**3. Feature Extraction 1 - Word Embedding**

  * *Word2Vec*   
  * *Global Vectors for Word Representation (GloVe)*
  * *Contextualized Word Representations*    
  * *FastText*

**4. Feature Extraction 2 - Weighted Words**

**5. Comparison of Feature Extraction Techniques**
